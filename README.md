I'm a frontend and blockchain developer with over 5 years of experience in the web3 space. 
Since 2018, I've developed my skills in different blockchain networks like Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Polkadot. 
I've successfully created and launched smart contracts, decentralized exchanges (DEX), and NFT marketplaces. 
Iâ€™ve completed projects using react/next.js, vue/nuxt.js, and angular. 
Thank you.
